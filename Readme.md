It's easier to understand what's happening if you can look at it.

`rxvision` is a tool to visualize and debug your RxJS reactive streams.

# The Demo [(see it live)](https://jaredly.github.io/rxvision)

You'll need `webpack` installed globally (`npm install -g webpack`).

```
npm install
webpack
```

Then you need to run a static server (so ajax will work in the demo). I use
`http-server` (`npm install -g http-server`):

```
http-server -p 4321
```

then open http://localhost:4321/examples/gh-follow/index.html in a browser.

# Usage

Check out the `gh-follow` source, or play with the playground [here](http://jaredly.github.io/rxvision/examples/playground/).
